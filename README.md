    <b>Aesthetic Spruce</b> is an unofficial fork of <a href="https://github.com/joneavila/aesthetic"><b>Aesthetic</b></a> by Jonathan Avila, being reworked into a <a href="https://github.com/spruceUI/spruceOS">spruceOS</a> app that generates themes directly on your handheld.

## 🌲 Aesthetic Spruce

Pick colours, a gradient, a font and a layout on the handheld; the app writes a complete PyUI theme to `Themes/<name>` and activates it.

## 📦 Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Built for **spruceOS 4.3.x, 4.4.x and 4.5.x** on aarch64 devices. The Miyoo A30 and Mini family are not supported — see [docs/DEVICES.md](docs/DEVICES.md) for the full list.

1. Download `AestheticSpruce_vX.Y.Z_sd-overlay.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/CatalyticArkun/aesthetic-spruce/releases). Nightlies are marked pre-release.
2. Unzip it onto the root of the spruceOS card, so that `App/AestheticSpruce` sits next to your other apps.
3. Launch ***Apps*** > ***Aesthetic Spruce***.

## ⚙️ Usage

1. From the main menu, pick the options to customise. Each screen shows its controls at the bottom; A confirms, B goes back, Start opens Settings.
2. Select **Build Theme** to write the theme to `Themes/<name>`.
3. Choose **Activate Now** to switch to it, or apply it later via ***Settings*** > ***Theme***.
4. Save and load presets from ***Settings*** (Start) > ***Save Theme Preset*** / ***Load Theme Preset***.

## ✨ What you can change

- **Colours** — background and foreground from a palette, an HSV picker or a hex code; solid or two-colour gradient; separate charging and low-battery colours.
- **Font** — *Inter*, *Montserrat*, *Nunito*, *JetBrains Mono*, *Cascadia Code*, *Retro Pixel* or *Bitter*.
- **Layout** — grid of tiles or a text list; box art width; title, clock, battery and button hints each shown or hidden.
- **System icons** — off, a glyph per family, the system's first letter, or SPRUCE's own art redrawn in the theme's colours (*SPRUCE Art*, two tones) or in one (*SPRUCE Mono*).
- **spruceOS options** — view type for the game list, systems and apps; Recents, Collections and Favorites tiles; index counter; screensaver timeout.
- **33 presets** — nine originals, ten RetroArch menu themes, twelve classic-system palettes and *MinUI* in black and white. Save your own alongside them.

Themes are written with your device's native resolution set plus the 640x480 base set, so they also work if you move the card to another handheld.
